  "sentimentQuestion": "The constant broadcasting of Bluetooth signals by personal devices creates a significant privacy risk that has been dangerously normalized.",

  "threadSummary": "The community largely agrees that the normalization of constant Bluetooth broadcasting poses a significant privacy risk, as reflected by a strong positive sentiment score. While many users expressed concern over wardriving and the potential to de-anonymize data through persistent device tracking, some debate exists regarding the effectiveness of MAC randomization in mitigating these threats. Overall, the discussion highlights a tension between the convenience of wireless ecosystems and the growing vulnerability to signal-based surveillance.",

      "text": "&gt; We’ve normalised the idea that Bluetooth is always on. Phones, laptops, smartwatches, headphones, cars, and even medical devices constantly broadcast their presence. The standard response to privacy concerns is usually “nothing to hide, nothing to fear.”<p>I guess anything you send out can be used to profile you.<p>Some of my friends live on a farm near a semi busy road, however far enough from other farms to not be able to receive their wifi. They showed me their router logging all the wifi accesspoints that appear&#x2F;disappear. There where A LOT of access points named &quot;Audi&quot;, &quot;BMW&quot;, &quot;Tesla&quot; etc. similar to those devices leaking bluetooth data. We had a discussion that it would be easy to determine who was passing by at what times due to these especially when you can &quot;de-anonymize&quot; the data for example link it to a numberplate.<p>I believe shopping malls often use such signals (wifi, bluetooth) to track what your travel pattern through the mall is. They know what section of the store you spend most of your time in and what storefronts you stall at.",

The short of it is, your phone can find your headphones or vice-versa, despite one or both having random addresses. The addresses can be regenerated or rotate at an interval (say 15 minutes). The first part of the address is a nonce (pRand), and the rest of the address is a 24-bit hash of pRand with an identity resolving key (IRK). So the other party just listens passively for addresses, and sees if any of them happen to have the right hash.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is as airtight as people think it is. Certainly, if you are following somebody and one address disappears right as another appears (rotation), it&#x27;s quite easy to infer the new&#x2F;old addresses belong to one device. I tried briefly to convince the Android developers to synchronize that rotation globally.<p>You can also probably infer that if you see a pair of random MACs arrive, and they have a certain pattern of timing and payload size, you can say with some certainty that they are particular devices, say an iPhone and an Apple Watch. But that requires sophisticated equipment since most Bluetooth LE communication is over a non-cryptographic frequency hopping arrangement.<p>Lastly, radio fingerprinting is widely known in academia, but requires special equipment.",

The DEA operates long standing and pervasive surveillance in “drug corridors” like I-95 from Maine to Miami. They do things like LPR and grabbing passenger pictures.<p>If Bluetooth is used, it may be a way to get a count of passengers or if the passengers change. I know based on newspaper accounts that they are particularly interested in cars that stop in Philly or Baltimore.<p>This stuff is frequently used against cops too so they may use the tech in similar ways. If you’re someone worried about getting raided, spotting a large number of new signals at the front door is an early warning potentially.",
