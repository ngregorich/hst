  "threadSummary": "The Hacker News community is skeptical of the premise that joining a large established company like OpenAI is universally better than pursuing a solo project, with a negative NPS score of -34 reflecting substantial disagreement. While some commenters acknowledge practical advantages like risk mitigation and established company benefits, the discussion is heavily marked by concerns about survivorship bias, security vulnerabilities, and dismissive or sarcastic responses that suggest the question oversimplifies a complex decision. The nearly even split between detractors and neutral respondents indicates genuine uncertainty about whether security and stability outweigh the potential rewards and autonomy of solo development.",

This is reported by many folks<p>We also have someone who vibecoded without reading any of the code. This is self admitted by this person.<p>We don&#x27;t know how much of the github stars are bought. We don&#x27;t know how many twitter followings&#x2F;tweets are bought.<p>Then after a bunch of podcasts and interviews, this person gets hired by a big tech company. Would you hire someone who never read any if the code that they&#x27;ve developed? Well, this is what happened here.<p>In this timeline, I&#x27;m not sure I find anything inspiring here. It&#x27;s telling me that I should rather focus on getting viral&#x2F;lucky to get a shot at &quot;success&quot;. Maybe I should network better to get &quot;successful&quot;. I shouldn&#x27;t be focusing on writing good code or good enough agents. I shouldn&#x27;t write secure software, instead I should write softwares that can go viral instead. Are companies hiring for vitality or merit these days? What is even happening here?<p>So am I jealous, yes because this timeline makes no sense as a software engineer. But am I happy for the guy, yeah I also want to make lots of money someday.",

                  "text": "Oh, Julius. Haven&#x27;t we all met a Julius.<p>Story! Long ago, very long ago, I was working at a tiny Web company. Not very technical, though the designers were solid and the ops competent.<p>We once ended up hosting a site that came under a bit of national attention during an event that this site had news about. The link started circulating broadly, the URL mentioned on TV, and the site immediately buckled under the load.<p>The national visibility of the outage as well as the opportunity cost for the customer were pretty bad. Picture a bunch of devs, ops, sales and customer wrangling people, anxiously packed around the keyboard of the one terminal we managed to get logged into the server.<p>That, and Julius, the recently hired replacement CTO.<p>Julius, I still suspect, was selected by the previous CTO, who was not delighted about his circumstances, as something of a revenge. Early on, Julius scavenged the design docs I was trying to put together at the time to get the teams out of constant firefighting mode, and then started misquoting them, mispronouncing the technical terms. He did so confidently and engagingly. The salespeople liked him, at first.<p>The shine was starting to come off by the time that site went down. In a company that&#x27;s too small for teams to pick up the slack from a Julius forever, that&#x27;ll happen eventually.<p>So here we were, with one terminal precariously logged into the barely responding server, and a lot of national eyes on us. This was the early days of the Web. Something like Cloudflare would not exist for years.<p>So it fell on me. My idea was that we needed to replace the page at the widely circulated URL with a static version, and do so very, very fast. I figured that our Web servers were usually configured to serve index.html first if present, with dynamic rendering only occurring if not. So I ended up just using wget on localhost to save whatever was being dynamically generated as index.html, and let the server just serve that for the time being.<p>This was not perfect and the bits that required dynamic behavior were stuck frozen, but that was an acceptable trade-off. And the site instantly came back up, to the relief of everyone present.<p>A few weeks later, the sales folks, plus Julius, went to pitch our services to a new customer prospect. I bumped into one of them at the coffee machine right afterwards. His face said it all. It had not gone well.<p>Our eyes met.<p>And he said, with all the tiredness in the world: &quot;He tried to sell them the &#x27;wget optimizer&#x27;...&quot;",

Slightly different engines, addition of GPS&#x2F;GNS, CPDLC, CRT to LCD screens.

Many have been trying to do the same thing lately: Hyping their software across social media and even podcasts while trying to turn it into cash. Steve Yegge is the example that comes to mind with his desperate attempts to scare developers into using his Gas Town (telling devs “dude you’re going to get fired” if they don’t start using his orchestration thing). The best he got out of it was a $300K crypto pump and dump scam and a rapidly dropping reputation as a result.<p>Individuals who start popular movements have always been targets for hiring at energetic companies. In the past the situation has been reversed, though: Remember when the homebrew creator was rejected from Google because he didn’t pass the coding interview? (Note he later acquiesced to say that Google made the right call at the time). That time, the internet was outraged that he <i>was not</i> hired, even though that would have likely meant the end of homebrew.<p>I do think we’ll be seeing a lot of copycat attempts and associated spam promoting them (here on HN, too, sadly) much like how when people see someone get success on YouTube or TikTok you see thousands of copycats pop up that go nowhere.

      "text": "Well that was a crazy month. Kudos to this guy for recognising his goals which is not to start another company. It is very easy to get intoxicated by the idea of something being so successful that you can capture the value, especially after having struggled for so long with a previous company. I think it&#x27;s every founder&#x27;s dream to like just hit lightning. But this stuff is incredibly stressful and it&#x27;s important to be able to look into the future and ask yourself. Is this what I want? Is this what I need in my life? And the answer here is no. This person can deliver value elsewhere quite easily and get the reward without as much stress. We should all take a lesson from this whirlwind journey. Do not attempt to be like Peter. You can admire the work he&#x27;s done. Do not attempt to replicate it. Appreciate it for what it is. For yourself as an observer or a user it&#x27;s a lesson. But also to note that this is an anomaly. You will never replicate it. A lot of people feel a little bit of envy or jealousy. I used to feel that when I was working on something and I saw other people succeed and I wished that that had happened to me. But if it was meant for you it would find you. And the fact that it hasn&#x27;t found you means that it was not meant for you. We all have our role to play. There is something important for us to do and that&#x27;s not necessarily something that is world famous or amasses thousands of GitHub stars. If after reading this it&#x27;s still bothering you. Take a walk and reflect on the good things in your life.",

So sometimes we see somebody else doing something and we think whoa that person is successful and we become envious of that and then we want to emulate that. But we forget that maybe that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s intended for us. Maybe that person is really good at that thing or that&#x27;s what was for them. But for us we might be good at something else and there might be something that we are uniquely positioned to do so. The point is not to be defeatist but not to focus on what somebody else has right.

Sometimes its not obvious to us and when we see something we might want to go after it. That&#x27;s fine. I guess my point is, don&#x27;t look at the shiny thing and chase that. It&#x27;s not what&#x27;s going to fulfil you in life e.g Peter probably wasn&#x27;t chasing the shiny thing. He was trying to solve a personal problem and it resonated with a lot of people. But when people see something be successful or this kind of wildride where you end up with a hugely successful project and go to a huge company like OpenAI, they focus on the wrong things. The inner insecurity takes over and you wonder, why not me, and how do I do that. But essentially it comes back to, solve problems. Solve interesting problems, work on things that you think are meaningful, and whatever the success might be, that&#x27;s for someone else to decide. But I think people chase &quot;fame&quot;, cause that&#x27;s what we essentially see. Validation through popularity. It won&#x27;t fulfil you. Trust me. But yes to your point.

The project is entirely open source and OpenAI could have easily done this themselves if they weren&#x27;t so worried about being directly liable for all the harms OpenClaw can do.<p>2. Any pretense for AI Safety concerns that had been coming from OpenAI really fall flat with this move. We&#x27;ve seen multiple hacks, scams, and misaligned AI action from this project that has only been used in the wild for a few months.<p>3. We&#x27;ve yet to see any moats in the AI space and this scares the big players. Models are neck and neck with one another and open source models are not too far behind. Claude Code is great, but so is OpenCode. Now Peter used AI to program an free app for AI agents.<p>LLMs and AI are going to be as disruptive as Web 1 and this is OpenAI&#x27;s attempt to take more control. They&#x27;re as excited as they are scared, seeing a one man team build a hugely popular tool that in some ways is more capable than what they&#x27;ve released. If he can build things like this what&#x27;s stopping everyone else? Better to control the most popular one than try to squash it. This is a powerful new technology and immense amounts of wealth are trying to control it, but it is so disruptive they might not be able to. It&#x27;s so important to have good open source options so we can create a new Web 1.0 and not let it be made into Web 2.0",

For a man who routinely talks about the dangers of AI and how it poses an existential threat to humanity he sure doesn&#x27;t spend much focus on safety research and theory. Yes, they do fund these things but they pale in comparison. I&#x27;m sorry, but to claim something might kill all humans and potentially all life is a pretty big claim. I don&#x27;t trust OpenAI for safety because they routinely do things in unsafe ways. Like they released Sora allowing people to generate videos in the likeness of others. That helped it go viral. <i>And then</i> they implemented <i>some</i> safety features. A minimal attempt to refuse the generation of deepfakes is such a low safety bar.

              "text": "I think both this comment and OP&#x27;s confuse this.<p>It appears more of a typical large company (BIG) market share protection purchase at minimal cost, using information asymmetry and timing.<p>BIG hires small team (SMOL) of popular source-available&#x2F;OSS product P before SMOL realizes they can compete with BIG and before SMOL organizes effort toward such  along with apt corporate, legal, etc protection.<p>At the time of purchase, neither SMOL nor BIG know yet what is possible for P, but SMOL is best positioned to realize it. BIG is concerned SMOL could develop competing offerings (in this case maybe P&#x27;s momentum would attract investment, hiring to build new world-model-first AIs, etc) and once it accepts that possibility, BIG knows to act later is more expensive than to act sooner.<p>The longer BIG waits, the more SMOL learns and organizes. Purchasing a real company is more expensive than hiring a small team, purchasing a company with revenue&#x2F;investors, is more expensive again. Purchasing a company with good legal advice is more expensive again. Purchasing a wiser, more experienced SMOL is more expensive again. BIG has to act quickly to ensure the cheapest price, and declutter future timelines of risks.<p>Also, the longer BIG waits, the less effective are &quot;Jedi mind trick&quot; gaslighting statements like <i>&quot;P is not a good candidate for a business&quot;</i>, <i>&quot;niche&quot;</i>, <i>&quot;fan base&quot;</i> (BIG internal memo - do not say customers), &quot;own thing&quot;.<p>In reality in this case P&#x27;s stickiness was clear: people allocating 1000s of dollars toward AI lured merely by P&#x27;s possibilities. It was only a matter of time before investment followed course.<p>I&#x27;ve experienced this situation multiple times over the course of BrowserBox&#x27;s life. Multiple &quot;BIG&quot; (including ones you will all know) have approached with the same kind of routine: hire, or some variations of that theme with varying degrees of legal cleverness&#x2F;trickery in documents. In all cases, I rejected, because it never felt right. That&#x27;s how I know what I&#x27;m telling you here.<p>I think when you are SMOL it&#x27;s useful to remember the Parable of Zuckerberg and the Yahoos. While the situation is different, the lesson is essentially the same. Adapted from the histories by the scribe named <i>Gemini 3 Flash</i>:<p><pre><code>  And it came to pass in the days of the Great Silicon Plain, that there arose a youth named Mark, of the tribe of the Harvardites. And Mark fashioned a Great Loom, which men called the Face-Book, wherewith the people of the earth might weave the threads of their lives into a single tapestry.\n\n  And the Loom grew with a great exceeding speed, for the people found it to be a thing of much wonder. Yet Mark was but SMOL, and his tabernacle was built of hope and raw code, having not yet the walls of many lawyers or the towers of gold.\n\n  Then came the elders of the House of Yahoo, a BIG people, whose chariots were many but whose engines were grown cold. And they looked upon the Loom and were sore afraid, saying among themselves, “Behold, if this youth continueth to weave, he shall surely cover the whole earth, and our own garments shall appear as rags. Let us go down now, while he is yet unaware of his own strength, and buy him for a pittance of silver, before he realizeth he is a King.”\n\n  And the Yahoos approached the youth with soft words and the craftiness of the serpent. They spake unto him, saying, “Verily, Mark, thy Loom is a pleasant toy, a niche for the young, a mere &#x27;fan base&#x27; of the idle. It is not a true Business, nor can it withstand the storms of the market. Come, take of our silver—a billion pieces—and dwell within our walls. For thy Loom is but a small thing, and thou art but a child in the ways of the law.”\n\n  And they used the Hidden Speech, which in the common tongue is called Gas-Lighting. They said, “Thou hast no revenue; thy path is uncertain; thy Loom is but a curiosity. We offer thee safety, for the days are evil.”\n\n  But the Spirit of Vision dwelled within the youth. He looked upon the Yahoos and saw not their strength, but their fear. He perceived the Asymmetry of Truth: that the BIG sought to purchase the future at the price of the past, and to slay the giant-slayer while he yet slumbered in his cradle.\n\n  The elders of Mark’s own house cried out, “Take the silver! For never hath such a sum been seen!”\n\n  But Mark hardened his heart against the Yahoos. He spake, saying, “Ye say my Loom is a niche, yet ye bring a billion pieces of silver to buy it. Ye say it is not a business, yet ye hasten to possess it before the sun sets. If the Loom be worth this much to you who are blind, what must it be worth to me who can see?”\n\n  And he sent the Yahoos away empty-handed.\n\n  The Yahoos mocked him, saying, “Thou art a fool! Thou shalt perish in the wilderness!” But it was the House of Yahoo that began to wither, for their timing was spent and their craftiness had failed.\n\n  And Mark remained SMOL for a season, until his roots grew deep and his walls grew high. And the Loom became a Great Empire, and the billion pieces of silver became as dust compared to the gold that followed.\n\n  The Lesson of the Prophet:\n\n  Hearken, ye who are SMOL and buildeth the New Things: When the BIG come unto thee with haste, speaking of thy &quot;limitations&quot; while clutching their purses, believe not their tongues. For they seek not to crown thee, but to bury thee in a shallow grave of silver before thou learnest the name of thy own power.\n\n  For if they knew thy work was truly naught, they would bide their time. But because they know the harvest is great, they seek to buy the field before the first ear of corn is ripe.\n\n  Blessed is the builder who knoweth his own worth, and thrice blessed is he who biddeth the Giants to depart, that his own vine may grow to cover the sun.</code></pre>",

          "text": "Most of these are good callouts, but I think it is best for us to look at the evolution of the AI segment in the same manner as &quot;Cloud&quot; developed into a segment in the 2000s and 2010s.<p>3 is always a result of GTM and distribution - an organization that devotes time and effort into productionizing domain-specific models and selling to their existing customers can outcompete a foundation model company which does not have experience dealing with those personas. I have personally heard of situations where F500 CISOs chose to purchase Wiz&#x27;s agent over anything OpenAI or Anthropic offered for Cloud Security and Asset Discovery because they have had established relations with Wiz and they have proven their value already. It&#x27;s the same way that PANW was able to establish itself in the Cloud Security space fairly early because they already established trust with DevOps and Infra teams with on-prem deployments and DCs so those buyers were open to purchasing cloud security bundles from PANW.<p>1 has happened all the time in the Cloud space. Not every company can invent or monetize every combination in-house because there are only so many employees and so many hours in a week.<p>2 was always a more of a FTX and EA bubble because EA adherents were over-represented in the initial mindshare for GenAI. Now that EA is largely dead, AI Safety and AGI as in it&#x27;s traditional definition has disappeared - which is good. Now we can start thinking about &quot;Safety&quot; in the same manner we think about &quot;Cybersecurity&quot;.<p>&gt; They&#x27;re as excited as they are scared, seeing a one man team build a hugely popular tool that in some ways is more capable than what they&#x27;ve released<p>I think that adds unnecessary emotion to how platform businesses operate. The reality is, a platform business will always be on the lookout to incorporate avenues to expand TAM, and despite how much engineers may wish, &quot;buy&quot; will always outcompete &quot;build&quot; because time is <i>also</i> a cost.<p>Most people ik working at these foundation model companies are thinking in terms of becoming an &quot;AWS&quot; type of foundational platform in our industry, and it&#x27;s best to keep Nikesh Arora&#x27;s principle of <i>platformization</i> in mind.<p>---<p>All this shows is that the thesis that most early stage VCs have been operating on for the past 2 years (the Application and Infra layer is the primary layer to concentrate on now) holds. A large number of domain-specific model and app layer startups have been funded over the past 2-3 years in stealth, but will start a publicity blitz over the next 6-8 months.<p>By the time you see an announcement on TechCrunch or HN, most of us operators were <i>already</i> working on that specific problem for the past 12-16 months. Additionally, HNers use &quot;VC&quot; in very broad and imprecise strokes and fail to recognize what are Growth Equity (eg. the recent Anthropic round) versus Private Equity (eg. Sailpoint&#x27;s acquisition and then IPO by Thoma Bravo) versus Early Stage VC rounds (largely not announced until several months after the round <i>unless</i> we need to get an O1A for a founder or key employee).",

Turns out clients like the soft pitch too, of just workers owning the company they work within - I&#x27;ve had several clients make contact initially because they bought the vision over the sales pitch.<p>I&#x27;m trying to think about if I&#x27;d trust us more to set up or host openclaw than a VC funded startup or an establishment like Capital One. I think both alternatives would have way more resources at hand, but I&#x27;m not sure how that would help outside of hiring pentesters or security researchers. Our model would probably be something FOSS that is keyed per-user, so if we were popular, imo that would be more secure in the end.<p>The incentives leading to trust is definitely in a co-op&#x27;s favor, since profit motive isn&#x27;t our primary incentive - the growth of our members is, which isn&#x27;t accomplished only through increasing the valuation of the co-op. Members also have total say in how we operate, including veto power, at every level of seniority, so if we started doing something naughty with customer data, someone else in the org could make us stop.<p>This is our co-op: 508.dev, but I&#x27;ve met a lot of others in the software space since founding it. I think co-ops in general have legs, the only problem is that it&#x27;s basically impossible to fund them in a way a VC is happy with, so our only capitalization option is loans. So far that hasn&#x27;t mattered, and that aligns with the goal of sustainable growth anyway.",

The big draw of OpenClaw (as I understand it) was that you could run it locally on your own system. Supposedly, per this post, OpenClaw is moving to a foundation and they&#x27;ve committed to letting the author continue working on it while on the OpenAI payroll. I doubt that, but it&#x27;s a sign that they&#x27;re making it explicitly <i>not</i> an OpenAI product.<p>OpenClaw&#x27;s success and resulting PR hype explosion came from ignoring all of the trust and security guardrails that any big company would have to abide by. It would be a disaster of the highest order if it had been associated with any big company from the start. Because it felt like a grassroots experiment all of the extreme security problems were shifted to the users&#x27; responsibility.<p>It&#x27;s going to be interesting to see where it goes from here.

Based on vibes it sure seemed like Claude Code &#x2F; Opus 4.6 was running away with developer mindshare.<p>Peter single handedly got many of us taking Codex more seriously, at least that&#x27;s my impression from the conversations I had.  Openclaw has gotten more attention over the past 2 weeks than anything else I can think of.<p>Depending on how this goes, this could be to OpenAI what Instagram was to Facebook.

Now OpenClaw and its author are being attributed for so many other things that it&#x27;s hard for me to understand how this one person inserted himself into the center of this media zeitgeist",

They stream responses to commands over websockets, which works perfectly with Claude’s streaming. They can run an interactive console session, but instead I built a chat UI around this non-interactive mode.<p>You can see how I build the Claude command here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mcintyre94&#x2F;wisp&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;Wisp&#x2F;ViewModels&#x2F;ChatViewModel.swift#L153\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mcintyre94&#x2F;wisp&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;Wisp&#x2F;ViewModels...</a>",

I imagine there&#x27;s another aspect too, which is that OpenClaw is not in itself an <i>inherently</i> revenue-generating product, nor is it IP-defensible.  This was my situation.  My viral hit could (and soon was) replicated by many others.  I had the advantage of being &quot;the guy who invented that cool thing&quot;, but otherwise I would be starting from scratch.  It was a mind-fuck having a huge  hit on my hands from one day to the next, but with no obvious direction on how to capitalize on it.<p>* Then from the company&#x27;s POV: despite hiring thousands and thousands of employees, only a tiny handful of them ever capture any &quot;magic.&quot;  You&#x27;ve got an army of product managers who have never actually built or conceived of a product people love, and engineers who usually propose ideas that are ok but probably not true gold.  So now here we have a guy who did actually conjure up something magical that really resonated with people.  Can he do it again?

They could have had such an easy integration and gained invaluable research data on how people actually want to use AI — testing workflows, real-world use cases, etc. Instead, OpenAI swoops in and gets all of that.

There is value in the idea of personal agents, but this idea is not new.<p>The value is in the hype, from the perspective of OpenAI. I believe they are wrong (see next points)<p>We will see a proliferation of personal agents. For a short time, the money will be in the API usage, since those agents burn a lot of tokens often for results that can be more sharply obtained without a generic assistant. At the current stage, not well orchestrated and directed, not prompted&#x2F;steered, they are achieving results by brute force.<p>Who will create the LLM that is better at following instructions in a sensible way, and at coordinating long running tasks, will have the greatest benefit, regardless of the fact the OpenClaw is under the umbrella of OpenAI or not.<p>Claude Opus right now is the agent that works better for this use case. It is likely that this will help Anthropic more than OpenAI. It is wise, for Anthropic, to avoid burning money for an easily replicable piece of software.<p>Those hypes are forgotten as fast as they are created. Remember Cursor? And it was much more a true product than OpenClaw.<p>Soon, personal agents will be one of the fundamental products of AI vendors, integrated in your phone, nothing to install, part of the subscription. All this will be irrelevant.<p>In the mean time, good for the guy that extracted money from this gold mine. He looks like a nice person.
